**[VisionPilot](https://github.com/visionpilot-project/VisionPilot)** ⭐ 10+  
A modular Python project for autonomous driving research. It combines computer vision, deep learning, and real-time sensor fusion to build perception and control systems for autonomous vehicles.

### What VisionPilot Does
- Lane detection (Traditional CV + SCNN)
- Traffic sign & light detection and classification
- Vehicle & pedestrian detection
- Multi-sensor fusion (Camera, LiDAR, Radar, GPS, IMU)
- Real-time autonomous driving with PID control
- Emergency braking (AEB) and cruise control
- Live visualization with Foxglove

### Demos
Check out the project in action on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@julian1777s) – demos covering lane keeping, traffic sign detection, emergency braking, and more.
